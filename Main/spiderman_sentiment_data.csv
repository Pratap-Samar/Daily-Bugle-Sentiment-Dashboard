The villains could be Vulture, Scorpion and maybe some gangs. Then we move on to his college days, arcs 4-7 cover him meeting Gwen, Harry and MJ, moving in with Harry and his relationship with Gwen. The villains could be the Lizard, Shocker and Doc Ock (to keep the continuity of Captain Stacy's death). Then the 8th arc is Gwen's death, 9-10 are Peter processing it, 11th is Harry as Green Goblin and 12th is Peter's college graduation and him dating MJ. \n\nThis leaves the authors with a young adult Peter (23), most basic cast members introduced and pretty much a blank slate to take the character wherever they want.\n\nIf a slightly older Peter is preferred, more arcs can be added, covering stuff like Symbiotes and Clones before kicking off with a late 20s/early 30s Peter.

The second and best-known story arc of this name ran from October 1994 to December 1996, and quickly became one of the most controversial Spider-Man stories ever told. Although it was intended to wrap up in less than a year, the comics sold very well and the writers were encouraged to prolong the saga as long as possible. This led to some changes to the storyline that ultimately proved divisive.Despite the controversy, the 1990s Clone Saga remains one of the most popular Spider-Man story arcs. Although many people were involved in its creation, the Clone Saga is most closely associated withTerry Kavanagh, who proposed the idea;Howard Mackie, who worked on the majority of the smaller crossovers involved in the overall story arc; andGerry Conway, who devised the original story.

Instead of trying to retcon the marriage and age Peter down.

Even though they play it for a joke, I did really like the bit about how after everything they've been through it's only fair to just call him Stephen. How many other people are on a first name basis with the (ex-) Sorcerer Supreme?\n\nI know some people dislike how involved Peter is (or I guess, *was*) with the Avengers in these movies, but personally I have really enjoyed seeing Spidey back where he belongs with the rest of the Marvel universe, and his various interactions and relationships with them."", 'The end of that movie fucked me up ... unforgettable', ""It's weird how this movie basically pulled a One More Day, but nobody complained because it was actually justified this time. Kind of funny how certain plot ideas from the comics were executed far better in their MCU iterations."", ""This also lets Tom's Spider-Man be more independent in the MCU. The avengers now don't know that he exists, and Spider-Man can operate more freely in his neighborhood and work with likes of daredevil. \nAny development in the MCU now doesn't necessarily need the involvement of this Spidey now."", ""I have a theory that strange included only himself as an exception in the spell.

Of course it's just a theory;)"", 'well he does say ""knows you"" which he\'s a part of', 'Yeah I didn‚Äôt notice that on my first viewing, but it makes the scene just that more sad.', ""Yeah that was a minor character detail that I caught too.

Part of being a human being."", 'the thing about this is\n\nDr. Strange obviously knows about the spell he used so Peter can at any time pull up to his house and tell him ""yea we had to use that forgetting spell to save our reality but surely you have a way to read minds right? so go ahead and check if im lying.""', 'Strange definitely cares for Peter.

And in NWH I felt like the entire time it was strange trying his best to make it up to Peter and give him a break. \n\nLoved it all tbh, and it‚Äôs heart breaking that they don‚Äôt know each other anymore like that but I‚Äôm sure in the future something will happen that‚Äôll reconnect them', 'FATHER FIGURE STRANGEEEEE', 'We don‚Äôt really get an explanation on that.

Peter then opts for the idea of having everyone forget who Peter is in general.

DeMatteisandMike Zeckpublished in 1987, featuring the final battle betweenMarvel ComicscharactersKraven the HunterandSpider-Man. Considered one of the greatest Spider-Man stories, the story was originally published inWeb of Spider-Man#31‚Äì32,The Amazing Spider-Man#293‚Äì294, andPeter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man#131‚Äì132, and less than two years later it was collected in atrade paperback, and it has been reprinted in that form numerous times since. No title for the overall storyline appears in the original comics, which simply refer to it as ""a 6-part saga"" on their covers. The initial editions of the trade paperback were titled ""Fearful Symmetry: Kraven's Last Hunt"", always with the ""Kraven's Last Hunt"" part in a much larger font, and later editions dropped the ""Fearful Symmetry"" part of the title entirely. The character Kraven the Hunter was retired from the story's original publication until 2009.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b5/Spider294.jpg/250px-Spider294.jpg,"['The noteworthy thing about Kraven‚Äôs Last Hunt is that it really set the Spider-Man comic on a path that it would be following for the next decade and more. This was an unprecedented kind of story in Spider-Man‚Äôs publication ‚Äì it was morbid, creepy, violent, and it had very little dialogue compared to what came before. It was also a look into a supporting character‚Äôs essence like we had never gotten before ‚Äì the profundity of characterization for Kraven in this story exceeds even what we get for Peter most of the time.\n\nJ.M. DeMatteis would write many other such stories later, including the conclusion to Pursuit, which I consider to be the best take on Chameleon to date. Other writers would also try to emulate this story‚Äôs tone and style, and I‚Äôd argue this was the example that Todd McFarlane was following when he wrote Torment. You can also see significant traces of it in the Clone Saga, in the hands of multiple different writers.', 'That page is a perfect meme template', ""This comic is extremely goated üî•\n\nAnd the craziest thing about it is that it's not even the symbiote suit he's wearing."", 'I appreciate that most every villain and hero knows when Peter stops talking, shit is real bad', 'That one page in Back in Black where he is all silent against Kingpin, as Kingpin gets angry at his silence screaming ""Say something goddammit"".

When he became Venom, he killed a police officer just for telling him to stop, and he killed a lot of people who didn‚Äôt really deserve it. It was only later, through his own comic, that he stopped being a villain and became more of an anti-hero. But even then, the line was blurry, and honestly, he was kind of a hypocrite', 'Oh yeah, venom was quite the bastard. Beating Felicia, breaking into Peter‚Äôs home and traumatizing MJ, killing people, he was always willing to go to extreme lengths by justifying that Spider-Man was the bigger villain. As long as he stops Spider-Man, the abuser of innocents, the ends justify the means - it was part of his twisted moral code. \n\n\n\nIt‚Äôs also what makes his turn into anti hero that much more rewarding and fascinating though.', ""That was true even during his early anti-hero phase, it was just a more popular trend at the time and people wanted 'badass' more than 'good person.'

He is what the power of Spider-Man would be without the conscience of Peter Parker to restrain it.', ""Venom is 100% a villain first, and for a while too. You're talking 100s of issues of him doing shit like this. Carnage brought a big sense of responsibility to Venom because while a villain, Venom was very angsty, and mired himself so much in his own origin. Spider-man was a villain to him. But once he finally put the lens on himself he started to realized how senseless his own journey as a villain was. Maximum Carnage was also a big push toward Venom being reformed. \n\nThat being said I love Venom as a villain, more than a hero. I get why his popularity kinda forced the hands of the writers which changed his character arc. However they may have killed him off or otherwise stop making stories with Venom had it not been for his reformation, so who's to say which is best Venom and which is worse."", 'It really is amazing how Venom has transitioned to being a more heroic character given how much of an asshole he was in the early days.', 'That‚Äôs how it is for a lot of characters.

The symbiote was bigger, faster and stronger than Peter.\nSo much so that at first, the hero could only win using cunning:\nThe first time he made Venom use so much web fluid in one fall, that it wore out the symbiote, another time, he appealed to the feelings that the symbiote had for him, and another time, he faked his own death on an island, so that Venom would leave him alone. \nThat's what I liked about him, the Arachnid couldn't defeat this enemy with just his fists, he had to use his intelligence to do so."", 'Well it\'s like the old saying goes: ""hell hath no fury like a symbiote scorned"" or something like that.', 'Ayo Felicia kinda caked up ngl', 'I grew up with OG Venom and he was absolutely a villain.

I am also a huge fan of MJS's run (despite the bad stories forced on him by Marvel's bad management at the time, see Sins Past and OMD). I really really loved all of Nick Spencer's run which the community seems a little divided on. And Dan Slott's was very hit and miss but I loved Spider-Island and Superior Spider-Man.

Instead of trying to retcon the marriage and age Peter down.

The Clone Saga,Various,October 1994-December 1996,Various,Various,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clone_Saga,"The ""Clone Saga"" is an extendedcomic-bookstoryline published byMarvel Comics, revolving around the superheroSpider-Manandclonesof him, as well as of other characters. The second and best-known story arc of this name ran from October 1994 to December 1996, and quickly became one of the most controversial Spider-Man stories ever told. Although it was intended to wrap up in less than a year, the comics sold very well and the writers were encouraged to prolong the saga as long as possible. This led to some changes to the storyline that ultimately proved divisive.Despite the controversy, the 1990s Clone Saga remains one of the most popular Spider-Man story arcs. Although many people were involved in its creation, the Clone Saga is most closely associated withTerry Kavanagh, who proposed the idea;Howard Mackie, who worked on the majority of the smaller crossovers involved in the overall story arc; andGerry Conway, who devised the original story. Executive editors on the storyline includedTom DeFalco,Bob Budiansky, andBob Harras.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4f/Web_of_Spider-Man_117.jpg/250px-Web_of_Spider-Man_117.jpg,"['It wasn‚Äôt dragged out, it didn‚Äôt try to get rid of Peter Parker, and it was pretty fun', ""It was shorter and more straightforward.\n\nThe Clone Saga was when I was most actively collecting comics. I look upon it with fond memories, despite what anyone says (valid criticisms, too, I'll admit), but it went on for far too long and flipflopped around the idea of Peter being the clone way too many times.\n\nThe *best* take on the Clone Saga for me will always be the one from Spider-Man Life Story, though."", 'It wasn‚Äôt just a drawn out between Ben & Peter over who was the real Spider-Man.

It was fun and insane, not angsty and existential. Peter never feared that he himself was a clone. All the identity issues were shouldered by poor Jess Drew so it wasn't front and center, but she was written sympathetically enough that it didn't feel like that aspect was being glossed over.\n\nAlso, it was written for a modern audience and had modern pacing. \n\nFinally, how could you not love goblinized werewolf MJ?"", 'Didn‚Äôt take half a decade to finish', ""Jessica Drew.

Couple that with Peter‚Äôs characterization being better than the original, a better villain in Doc Ock, more concise storytelling, and just an excellent, much more intimate, raw writing? Think it all added up to just being the best Spidey ‚ÄúClone Story‚Äù.', 'It was less complicated and they did not ""retcon"" things in weird ways like the original had done.\nThe ultimate version also was important for the development of the characters and had lasting consequences, what made it stand out against the original and a lot of comic book events.', 'It wasn‚Äôt long, was actually written well. And wasn‚Äôt put in 4 separate Spider-Man comics along with the other 40 stories it was sprinkled in.', 'Well for starters, the benefit of hindsight to know not to overextend it.

Like The original Clone Saga was this sprawling event over many years while the Clone Saga was a 7 part story arc. It's doing different things differently. Speaking personally there are parts of the Clone Saga, like ASM#400 or the Lost Years that are better than Bendis' USM. But in terms of doing the clone saga and making it a Spider-Man story, Bendis maybe did it a bit better. \n\nWhat I mean is the major problem with the original Clone Saga is that it just didn't feel like Spider-Man, conspiracies and secret labs under the woods and a universe where every second person knows Peter is Spider-Man that's not a Spider-Man story in the sense that existed before the Clone Saga. Now of course it's not like the same problem doesn't exist with Ultimate Spider-Man, because it does but since it's a new continuity, there's not the expectation of living up to its classical ethos that will always be there in 616. \n\nWhat I mean is Bendis made the clones interesting...so you know rather than Ben Reilly, peter but blonde, you have a female Peter clone, who he calls Jessica Drew to more organically work in Spider-Woman than the original 616 character who just had that name because Stan Lee wanted Marvel to retain exclusive spider-suffix characters. Having Ultimate Octopus as a villain works better than Jackal, aka the worst designed villain in Spider-Man."", ""Honestly my only problem with it is that.\n\n1: Jessica didn't stick to the main cast.\n\n2: They forgot about the scorpion clone."", ""FUN FACT: Tarantula actually survived his demise and became part of Miguel O'Hara's Spider-Society.

She doesn't like Peter Parker so she doesn't need to know who's under the mask. It would be a compelling story too as Peter would be torn between taking the rough path of getting MJ to remember him in hopes she'd even like him that way again or the easy path of Black Cat who doesn't care and would likely show him the fun side of that life. Not saying he'd steal, but maybe he is slow to put two and two together that she's behind a recent string of high-end thefts cause she gets him to relax too much. Maybe set it like a year or two later so we can buy him aging up a bit more so Cat can be more of an adult flirt."", 'The next Spider-Man Trilogy is gonna be set in college.

He‚Äôll meet her as Spider-Man and they‚Äôll grow close as Spider-Man. He‚Äôll probably meet Felicia in college or something.\n\nEventually something will happen; maybe Walter Hardy will die and Peter will learn Cat‚Äôs identity and start to feel the same guilt he felt in NWH; even though he wouldn‚Äôt let himself get close to Felicia he still feels like he‚Äôs responsible for her loss.\n\nCat will help him learn that it was her choice to be part of Spider-Man‚Äôs life and her fathers choice to lead the life he led.

However, with the Foreigner‚Äôs casting in Kraven all but confirming Silver Sable for the SSU, I‚Äôve since been worried that next on the agenda is the other half of the shelved Silver & Black project.\n\nFrankly, I don‚Äôt mind Sony using her in their movies. It‚Äôs not as if my sentiment would influence the outcome either way.

The mask stays on."", 'Maybe he could grow a little scruff to sell it :)', ""I mean, that was Homecoming wasn't it? He didn't need to protect Liz"", 'Can‚Äôt see them redoing old concepts like that.', 'One of the main differences between Selina and Felicia is that whereas Selina is Bruce‚Äôs primary love interest (with Talia taking on the Black Cat role in that sense), Peter‚Äôs is MJ, and so Felicia is a bit of a wild card. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve read the comment that pops up under every Batman YouTube clip which points out how Bruce Wayne is Batman‚Äôs secret identity rather than vice versa. This means that he has little to no interest in his civilian life. More often than not, Wayne Enterprises becomes an accessory for his vigilantism through the wizardry of Lucius Fox. Alfred, Bruce‚Äôs butler and childhood caretaker, also assists from the Batcave. Even his various adopted children (as well as his biological son) are trained to one day join him in the field. Bruce has little empathy for others because empathy is a human emotion, and he spends most of his life trying to be something more (or less) than human, and this is because he has chosen to be Batman.\n\nSelina understands this because she grew up a homeless orphan. She spent her adolescence and early adult years pimping herself out. She lacks the discipline to lead a normal, ‚Äòhuman‚Äô lifestyle. Although Bruce is more committed to living his life as Batman, he has shown a willingness to hang up the cowl and settle with Selina, as he does in The Dark Knight Rises. This is because in spite of their lack of empathy, they are drawn together by their ability to relate to one another. Selina and Bruce are as close to a perfect fit as either one of them will ever get.\n\nMeanwhile, Peter‚Äôs vigilantism is a burden bestowed upon him by nothing more than pure coincidence. He takes his responsibilities in his stride, but ultimately, that‚Äôs all that his life as Spider-Man is ‚Äì a responsibility. He doesn‚Äôt let himself disappear within his costume because most of the time, he would rather be somewhere else. Felicia scoffs at Peter‚Äôs life with MJ because she sees its ordinariness as mundane, but that‚Äôs just who Peter is. He needs a normal civilian to help fulfil his normal desires as a citizen of the world.\n\nPeter and Felicia never work out because neither of them truly appeal to the preferred lives of their opposite number. Felicia‚Äôs civilian life was ruined when she was raped at college, so she left it all behind to put on a mask and live her life on the edge, as she is afraid of letting her guard down. The suddenness of Felicia‚Äôs transition into vigilantism contrasts with Selina‚Äôs experiences, as she grew up with a distant mother and an alcoholic father before they both died. This made her resilient and self-reliant, so her empathy for others didn‚Äôt have to be placed aside all of a sudden. Selina‚Äôs self-assurance is rooted in the gradual nature of her situation, so she has grown up with her current mentality and has shaped it into something that can benefit the people she cares for. Meanwhile, Felicia is a scared emotional wreck who initially acts impulsively and trusts no one other than her father. Felicia tries to mould Peter into embracing her adrenaline-fuelled lifestyle because subconsciously, she doesn‚Äôt actually trust him enough to open up to him. That, or she was reborn as a consequence of her trauma and has disregarded her comparatively innocent childhood. Either way, Peter rejects her cynical (implicit) philosophy because he doesn‚Äôt even want to live his life at 100mph, let alone know how to. And since Felicia has blocked out any notion of grounding herself, Peter invariably returns to his comfort zone in MJ or another love interest, and Felicia to hers in solitude.\n\nOf course, movies are finite, so rather than make Felicia an eternal sociopath, I‚Äôd build her arc around gaining a conscience and developing emotions for others. While Felicia would try to loosen up the reserved and awkward Peter, Peter would use his humanity to show Felicia a world in which she can love and expect to be loved back. This building of trust would help her start doing the right thing more often. It might not guarantee her a future with Peter, but she‚Äôd be very close to becoming a hero of her own by the end of her final appearance.', ""I think Black Cat could actually be an asset if that's the story they want to tell. Have it be about Peter neglecting Peter stuff and throwing himself in to his career as Spider-Man to distract himself from his loss.

Absolute Carnage,Various,August 2019,Donny Cates,Ryan Stegman,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_Carnage,"While walking toTimes Square,Eddie Brockexplains to his sonDylan Brockabout how theSymbioteswere created byKnullas well as the Church of the New Darkness having resurrectedCletus Kasady. Upon arrival, Eddie notices that there are wanted posters for Venom for the deaths of Lee Price and several inmates at Ryker's Island. When they flee into the subway upon being trailed by a man in a trenchcoat, they encounter Kasady, who shoves them onto the subway tracks. They are saved by the man in the trenchcoat who is actually theVenomsymbiote in disguise. The Venom symbiote re-bonds to Eddie, stating that it has fully recovered from the dark magic that it absorbed. A pair of police officers arrive and hold Venom at gunpoint. When the train explodes, Venom shields Dylan asDark Carnageappears. Venom tells the police officers to get Dylan as far away from here as possible while he confronts Dark Carnage where he notices that Kasady's body is bonded to theGrendelsymbiote. As Dark Carnage tries to rip Venom off of Eddie, he claims that Knull is coming to destroy everything. Eddie uses the electrical rails of the subway to disable Dark Carnage as it briefly separates to reveal Kasady's corpse.

I would give his best (Superior, Spider-Island. Spider-Verse) a B+ and the rest a B-. So overall a solid B.

The Stan Lee run (the original 6 are incredible and then Romita's run is the definitive Spider-Man era for me), then the Conway run. After that I really like Spider-Man:  Blue, Kraven's Last Hunt, and Marvel Knights.  \n\n\nNot breaking any ground here, these are widely beloved. I am also a huge fan of MJS's run (despite the bad stories forced on him by Marvel's bad management at the time, see Sins Past and OMD). I really really loved all of Nick Spencer's run which the community seems a little divided on. And Dan Slott's was very hit and miss but I loved Spider-Island and Superior Spider-Man. And finally I am a big fan of Untold Tales of Spider-Man and all the Spider-Girl comics are kind my head cannon true continuity. ;)  \n\n\nI would have loved it if they allowed Peter to keep growing up and we saw him and MJ raise a child for all these years. Instead of trying to retcon the marriage and age Peter down. I also hate that they retconned MJS's death of Aunt May which I thought was a wonderful story and worthy of being among the classics like The Night Gwen Stacy Died. But management were obsessed with keeping Peter young and single!

He needs to be the antagonist, and then be gone. Unless you are doing Knull, Venom isn't big enough to be the bad guy for multiple heroes. Even then Knull is the Thanos equivalent, not Venom. Venom would be Loki in that aspect.\n\nThe modern method of movie making discourages multiple actors playing the same characters, restricting movies to center only on their universe and only on so many movies. Room to flesh out antagonists is tight, and for a iconic, beloved character like Venom, you need to put the focus squarely on him and spiderman.

Sony realizes they have a character they can actually build an IP around on its own, and they want to make Venom his own thing instead of a Spidey-world secondary character.

I do think they're losing something great about the character in doing this, to be clear, but I understand it from their perspective.\n\nThat said, I've loved what they've done with symbiotes in the comics.

Gooey tendrils instead of webs and the big build with massive strength tend to make Venom a bit more unique compared to Spidey. Sure it does take away from the dark mirror aspect that comics Venom had, but I think it works a bit better with the idea of the symbiote being a goop alien that enhances its host. It\'s a bit weird when the symbiote just gives people spider powers with normal webbing and the ability to stick to walls. \n\nI will say that I like how some adaptations have Venom using the symbiote\'s body to create black ""webbing"" and using claws or the symbiote\'s goopiness to stick to walls.

I enjoyed Spider-Man 2 the game but damn it would have been much more cool if they kept the city wide symbiote infestation thing out (it‚Äôs been done already in video games) and made the game about Kraven and harry and the shoe dropping then venom harassing them over and over with out killing them, just letting them know he could until he finally came for them in the end and the spidermen find a way.', 'Doesnt he only swing from webs because he gets it after bonding to spiderman?

Those have the chance of being the greatest and most terrifying nemesis, if used correctly.\n\nBut oh no, he became popular. So let\'s give him a solo series where he\'s a hero now, oopsies. And let\'s slowly take away everything that makes him cool or interesting and pass the symbiote around like it\'s a bong at a fraternity. And nowadays Eddie Brock is a cosmic being and we\'re supposed to believe that Venom\'s symbol has always been a dragon and not a huge spider. [Sigh]\n\nI actually think that they lost the plot the moment they came up with Carnage. You know, ‚ÄúVenom"" has that name because some spiders are venomous.
