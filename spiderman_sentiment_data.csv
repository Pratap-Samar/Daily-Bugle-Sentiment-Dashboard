The Clone Saga,Various,October 1994-December 1996,Various,Various,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clone_Saga,"The ""Clone Saga"" is an extendedcomic-bookstoryline published byMarvel Comics, revolving around the superheroSpider-Manandclonesof him, as well as of other characters. The second and best-known story arc of this name ran from October 1994 to December 1996, and quickly became one of the most controversial Spider-Man stories ever told. Although it was intended to wrap up in less than a year, the comics sold very well and the writers were encouraged to prolong the saga as long as possible. This led to some changes to the storyline that ultimately proved divisive.Despite the controversy, the 1990s Clone Saga remains one of the most popular Spider-Man story arcs. Although many people were involved in its creation, the Clone Saga is most closely associated withTerry Kavanagh, who proposed the idea;Howard Mackie, who worked on the majority of the smaller crossovers involved in the overall story arc; andGerry Conway, who devised the original story. Executive editors on the storyline includedTom DeFalco,Bob Budiansky, andBob Harras.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4f/Web_of_Spider-Man_117.jpg/250px-Web_of_Spider-Man_117.jpg,"['It wasn‚Äôt dragged out, it didn‚Äôt try to get rid of Peter Parker, and it was pretty fun', ""It was shorter and more straightforward.\n\nThe Clone Saga was when I was most actively collecting comics.

But in terms of doing the clone saga and making it a Spider-Man story, Bendis maybe did it a bit better. \n\nWhat I mean is the major problem with the original Clone Saga is that it just didn't feel like Spider-Man, conspiracies and secret labs under the woods and a universe where every second person knows Peter is Spider-Man that's not a Spider-Man story in the sense that existed before the Clone Saga. Now of course it's not like the same problem doesn't exist with Ultimate Spider-Man, because it does but since it's a new continuity, there's not the expectation of living up to its classical ethos that will always be there in 616. \n\nWhat I mean is Bendis made the clones interesting...so you know rather than Ben Reilly, peter but blonde, you have a female Peter clone, who he calls Jessica Drew to more organically work in Spider-Woman than the original 616 character who just had that name because Stan Lee wanted Marvel to retain exclusive spider-suffix characters.

He didn't need to protect Liz"", 'Can‚Äôt see them redoing old concepts like that.', 'One of the main differences between Selina and Felicia is that whereas Selina is Bruce‚Äôs primary love interest (with Talia taking on the Black Cat role in that sense), Peter‚Äôs is MJ, and so Felicia is a bit of a wild card. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve read the comment that pops up under every Batman YouTube clip which points out how Bruce Wayne is Batman‚Äôs secret identity rather than vice versa. This means that he has little to no interest in his civilian life. More often than not, Wayne Enterprises becomes an accessory for his vigilantism through the wizardry of Lucius Fox. Alfred, Bruce‚Äôs butler and childhood caretaker, also assists from the Batcave. Even his various adopted children (as well as his biological son) are trained to one day join him in the field. Bruce has little empathy for others because empathy is a human emotion, and he spends most of his life trying to be something more (or less) than human, and this is because he has chosen to be Batman.\n\nSelina understands this because she grew up a homeless orphan. She spent her adolescence and early adult years pimping herself out. She lacks the discipline to lead a normal, ‚Äòhuman‚Äô lifestyle. Although Bruce is more committed to living his life as Batman, he has shown a willingness to hang up the cowl and settle with Selina, as he does in The Dark Knight Rises. This is because in spite of their lack of empathy, they are drawn together by their ability to relate to one another. Selina and Bruce are as close to a perfect fit as either one of them will ever get.\n\nMeanwhile, Peter‚Äôs vigilantism is a burden bestowed upon him by nothing more than pure coincidence. He takes his responsibilities in his stride, but ultimately, that‚Äôs all that his life as Spider-Man is ‚Äì a responsibility. He doesn‚Äôt let himself disappear within his costume because most of the time, he would rather be somewhere else. Felicia scoffs at Peter‚Äôs life with MJ because she sees its ordinariness as mundane, but that‚Äôs just who Peter is. He needs a normal civilian to help fulfil his normal desires as a citizen of the world.\n\nPeter and Felicia never work out because neither of them truly appeal to the preferred lives of their opposite number. Felicia‚Äôs civilian life was ruined when she was raped at college, so she left it all behind to put on a mask and live her life on the edge, as she is afraid of letting her guard down. The suddenness of Felicia‚Äôs transition into vigilantism contrasts with Selina‚Äôs experiences, as she grew up with a distant mother and an alcoholic father before they both died. This made her resilient and self-reliant, so her empathy for others didn‚Äôt have to be placed aside all of a sudden. Selina‚Äôs self-assurance is rooted in the gradual nature of her situation, so she has grown up with her current mentality and has shaped it into something that can benefit the people she cares for. Meanwhile, Felicia is a scared emotional wreck who initially acts impulsively and trusts no one other than her father. Felicia tries to mould Peter into embracing her adrenaline-fuelled lifestyle because subconsciously, she doesn‚Äôt actually trust him enough to open up to him. That, or she was reborn as a consequence of her trauma and has disregarded her comparatively innocent childhood. Either way, Peter rejects her cynical (implicit) philosophy because he doesn‚Äôt even want to live his life at 100mph, let alone know how to. And since Felicia has blocked out any notion of grounding herself, Peter invariably returns to his comfort zone in MJ or another love interest, and Felicia to hers in solitude.\n\nOf course, movies are finite, so rather than make Felicia an eternal sociopath, I‚Äôd build her arc around gaining a conscience and developing emotions for others. While Felicia would try to loosen up the reserved and awkward Peter, Peter would use his humanity to show Felicia a world in which she can love and expect to be loved back.

For Insomniac's... Yeah, they both underused and really fumbled the character. At least it looks pretty cool"", ""Venom is only spiderman's dark mirror after he bonds to Peter. He never bonds to Peter in the movies, so there's no reason for him to have spider powers. Thats literally why he has the spider emblem, because he attached to Peter first, and wants Peter as a host. In the game, I don't know what their excuse is. Venom sprouts wings and flies so it's just wild."", 'I noticed this too,when the last time hes swung on his webs,I cant name a time.That is a good point,I do want the Spider-centric aspect of him to come back', 'It makes sense, comics have been moving Venom away from being a Spidey Charcater (e.g. the whole King In Black stuff is venom centric and has nothing to do with Spidey) so it makes senses that adaptions would also start doing that as well', 'I think the hulkish Venom is the Ultimate version', 'Giving Venom toes was the start of a really long line of character assassination lol', 'I‚Äôm no expert, but doesn‚Äôt Venom swing around and do web stuff after merging with Peter? Like he ‚Äútook inspiration‚Äù from spidey?', ""Because modern writers don't know or understand the character whatsoever beyond the most surface level stuff, they just think he's hulk with slimy black skin and sharp teeth"", ""I don't like that all tendrils and tentacles stuff they did with him, or even with the black suit in some games...  \nONe tentacle pull is ok, something growing from his back to show he's out of control.  \nBUT WHY IS HE HEADING UP ON A PILE OF TENTACLE GOO?  \nI think this started with spider-man web of shadows, I can see knull doing this, but venom is a minion, as I see, being connected with spidey made sim so powerfull, he was feeding on spidey while was making he's stronger, it's not giving him new power and stuff.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zab4jfe9g5mf1.png?width=757&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecad55ede388159be3e2d5bac5265b6383204280"", 'It made sense for the Venom movies, but definitely not the Spider-Man 2 game. I mean, the symbiote learns how to make webs from being bonded to Spider-Man, no Spidey, no webs. \n\nThe change that bothers me most is that the symbiote basically controls the host. Eddie had no agency or control while ‚Äúin Venom form‚Äù which is in line with your Hulk comparison.', ""frrrr, Venom is used to be a decent to good anti-hero by 2014-2016 times if i am not wrong  \ni feel like SSU's Spider-Man less Venom ruined the character's adaptation in a way? and the bringing in off KNull and symbiotes war in comics just bombarded his lore.... in a bad way?\n\ni think Agent Venom was a pretty nice change, to Flash and the symbiote as well"", 'With fairness to the Sony films they were experimenting with movies without Spider-Man because of the MCU', 'When you separate Venom‚Äôs origin from Spider-Man, you cannot then give him the same powers. In the original comics, the black suit adapted to what Peter wanted to do while wearing it. When they separated, it adapted again to be able to hunt him.\n\nIf you decide to make a movie universe with all of Spider-Man‚Äôs cast of characters, but no Spider-Man, it doesn‚Äôt make sense for Venom to develop the same powers. So instead, he gets the abilities a symbiote has without ever encountering Spider-Man.\n\nThe Ultimate comics in the 2000‚Äôs features a Venom that doesn‚Äôt seem to ever adapt to Spider-Man‚Äôs powers (at least not as far as I remember), and the Tom Hardy films seem to mostly adapt this Venom‚Äôs power set and schtick.\n\nHaven‚Äôt played the PS5 game, so I can‚Äôt speak to that one, but if it doesn‚Äôt get Spider-Man‚Äôs abilities, then I would guess it had to do with game design, ie wanting to change up the gameplay from regular Spider-Man or something. At this point they have a lot of versions of the character to pull from, so if they didn‚Äôt want another character that plays like Spider-Man, they didn‚Äôt have to.']",100
